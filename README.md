### Build instructions

Before doing anything, ensure you have the following things on the build machine:

* A 64-bit Intel Mac running OS X 10.10+
* Xcode 7.x+ installed (must have the OS X 10.11 SDK)

DO NOT open FreenetTray.xcodeproj directly! The application requires CocoaPods, 
which will build the 3rd party library dependencies for you and generate an Xcode 
workspace for you to use.

##### Build steps

First, open a terminal and change directory to the source code location:

```sh
$ cd /path/to/mactray/
```

You will then need to install CocoaPods:

```sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Now allow CocoaPods to download and build the required 3rd party libraries:

```sh
$ pod install
```

Cocoapods may take a few minutes, but quickly display build results like this:

```text
Analyzing dependencies

Downloading dependencies
Installing CocoaAsyncSocket <version number>
Installing IYLoginItem <version number>
Generating Pods project
Integrating client project
```

Now there should be a FreenetTray.xcworkspace file, open it:

```sh
$ open FreenetTray.xcworkspace 
```

Now you can build and run the application, or archive it for distribution.

When built against the OS X 10.11 SDK, the built application should be fully 
compatible with 64-bit Intel Macs running OS X 10.8 - OS X 10.11.
